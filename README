NAME
    Tenjin - Fast templating engine with support for embedded Perl.

SYNOPSIS
            use Tenjin;
            $Tenjin::USE_STRICT = 1; # use strict in the embedded Perl inside
                                     # your templates. Optional but recommended.

            my $engine = new Tenjin::Engine();
            my $context = { title => 'Tenjin Example', items => [qw/AAA BBB CCC/] };
            my $filename = 'file.html';
            my $output = $engine->render($filename, $context);
            print $output;

DESCRIPTION
    Tenjin is a very fast and full-featured templating engine, implemented
    in several programming languages. It supports embedded Perl, nestable
    layout template, inclusion of other templates inside a template,
    capturing parts of or the entire template output, file and memory
    caching, template arguments and preprocessing.

    Tenjin also comes with a command line application, "pltenjin", for
    rendering templates. For example, "pltenjin example.html" will render
    the template stored in the example.html file. You can also convert a
    template to Perl code by using "pltenjin -s example.html". This is the
    code used internally by Tenjin when rendering templates. There are more
    options, checkout SEE ALSO for links to the usage guides.

SEE ALSO
    The original Tenjin website is located at
    <http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/>. In there check out
    <http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/pltenjin-users-guide.html> for
    detailed usage guide,
    <http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/pltenjin-examples.html> for examples,
    and <http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/pltenjin-faq.html> for frequently
    asked questions.

    Note that the Perl version of Tenjin is refered to as plTenjin on the
    Tenjin website, and that, as oppose to this module, the website suggests
    using a .plhtml extension for the templates instead of .html (this is
    entirely your choice).

    Tenjin::Engine, Tenjin::Template, Catalyst::View::Tenjin.

TODO
    *   Check if all the sub-modules (like Tenjin::Context, Tenjin::HTML,
        etc.) are really necessary.

    *   In particular, check if Tenjin::HTML can be replaced with some
        existing CPAN module.

    *   Add the documentation files linked in SEE ALSO to the module
        distribution, like in the original Tenjin.

    *   Expand the description of this module.

    *   Create tests, adapted from the tests provided by the original
        Tenjin.
