NAME
    Tenjin - Fast templating engine with support for embedded Perl.

SYNOPSIS
            use Tenjin;

            $Tenjin::USE_STRICT = 1;        # use strict in the embedded Perl inside
                                            # your templates. Recommended, but not used
                                            # by default.

            $Tenjin::ENCODING = "utf8";     # set the encoding of your template files
                                            # to utf8. This is the default encoding used
                                            # so there's no need to do this if your
                                            # templates really are utf8.

            my $engine = Tenjin->new(\%options);
            my $context = { title => 'Tenjin Example', items => [qw/AAA BBB CCC/] };
            my $filename = 'file.html';
            my $output = $engine->render($filename, $context);
            print $output;

VERSION
    0.052

DESCRIPTION
    Tenjin is a very fast and full-featured templating engine, implemented
    in several programming languages, among them Perl.

    The Perl version of Tenjin supports embedded Perl code, nestable layout
    template, inclusion of other templates inside a template, capturing
    parts of or the entire template output, file and memory caching,
    template arguments and preprocessing.

    The original version of Tenjin is developed by Makoto Kuwata. This CPAN
    version is developed by Ido Perlmuter and differs from the original in a
    few key aspects:

    *   Code is entirely revised, packages are separated into modules, with
        a smaller number of packages than the original version. In
        particular, the Tenjin::Engine module no longer exists, and is now
        instead just the Tenjin module (i.e. this one).

    *   Support for rendering templates from non-files sources (such as a
        database) is added.

    *   Ability to set the encoding of your templates is added.

    *   HTML is encoded and decoded using the HTML::Entities module, instead
        of internally.

    *   The "pltenjin" script is not provided, at least for now.

    To make it clear, this version of Tenjin might somehow divert from the
    original Tenjin's roadmap. Although my aim is to be as compatible as
    possible (and this version is always updated with features and changes
    from the original), I cannot guarantee it. Please note that version 0.05
    of this module is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions.

METHODS
  new \%options
    This creates a new instant of Tenjin. "\%options" is a hash-ref
    containing Tenjin's configuration options:

    *   path - Array-ref of filesystem paths where templates will be
        searched

    *   prefix - A string that will be automatically prepended to template
        names when searching for them in the path. Empty by default.

    *   postfix - The default extension to be automtically appended to
        template names when searching for them in the path. Don't forget to
        include the dot, such as '.html'. Empty by default.

    *   cache - If set to 1 (the default), compiled templates will be cached
        on the filesystem.

    *   preprocess - Enable template preprocessing (turned off by default).
        Only use if you're actually using any preprocessed Perl code in your
        templates.

    *   layout - Name of a layout template that can be optionally used. If
        set, templates will be automatically inserted into the layout
        template, in the location where you use "[== $_content ==]".

    *   strict - Another way to make Tenjin use strict on embedded Perl code
        (turned off by default).

    *   encoding - Another way to set the encoding of your template files
        (set to utf8 by default).

  render( $tmpl_name, [\%context, $layout] )
    Renders a template whose name is identified by $tmpl_name. Remember that
    a prefix and a postfix might be added if they where set when creating
    the Tenjin instance.

    $context is a hash-ref containing the variables that will be available
    for usage inside the templates. So, for example, if your "\%context" is
    { message => 'Hi there }, then you can use $message inside your
    templates.

    $layout is a flag denoting whether or not to render this template into
    the layout template there was set when creating the Tenjin instance.

    Please note that file templates are cached on disk (with a '.cache')
    extension. Tenjin automatically deprecates these cache files every 10
    seconds. If you find this value is too low, you can override the
    $Tenjin::TIMESTAMP_INTERVAL variable with your preferred value.

SEE ALSO
    The original Tenjin website is located at
    <http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/>. In there check out

    asked questions.

    Note that the Perl version of Tenjin is refered to as plTenjin on the
    Tenjin website, and that, as oppose to this module, the website suggests
    using a .plhtml extension for the templates instead of .html (this is
    entirely your choice).

    Tenjin::Template, Catalyst::View::Tenjin.

CHANGES
    This version of Tenjin breaks backwards compatibility with previous
    versions. In particular, the Tenjin::Engine module does not exist any
    more and is instead integrated into this one. Templates are also
    rendered entirely different (as per changes in the original tenjin)
    which provides much faster rendering.

    Upon upgrading to this version, you MUST perform the following changes
    for your applications (or, if you're using Catalyst, you must also
    upgrade Catalyst::View::Tenjin):

    *   "use Tenjin" as your normally would, but to get an instance of
        Tenjin you must call "Tenjin->new()" instead of the old method of
        calling "Tenjin::Engine->new()".

    *   Remove all your templates cache files (they are the '.cache' files
        in your template directories), they are not compatible with the new
        templates structure and WILL cause your application to fail if
        present.

TODO
    *   Expand pod documentation and properly document the code, which is
        hard to understand as it is.

    *   Create tests, adapted from the tests provided by the original
        Tenjin.

AUTHOR
    Tenjin is developed by Makoto Kuwata at
    <http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/>. The CPAN version was tidied and
    CPANized from the original 0.0.2 source (with later updates from Makoto
    Kuwata's tenjin github repository) by Ido Perlmuter <ido@ido50.net>.
